# SNL
A simple networking library (snl) written in c++ and an example of usage (shamelessly stolen from Erik~~k~~ Kvist (ish)).

# Usage
## Building
Run
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
on you favorite unix-based operating system to build the project.
Then run the server/client with
```
./server
```
and
```
./client
```

## The client interface
Figure it out or something -- idk. It's pretty trivial.
